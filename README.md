# Expenses-manager
A simple expenses tracking application written in Java.

## Installing
Packages to download will be available when I consider that it can be called version 1.0 :)

## Features
+ **Multiple local profiles:** You can create as many profiles as you want, for each new one there is a *.csv file created to keep track of expenses.
+ **Transactions overview:** Graphical representation of transactions, continuously updated values of current month's expenses and remaining budget.

For those who would rather see it in action, wait a moment, gif with a simple demo is loading beneath.

Unfortunately, not much can be seen because the technology which I am using does not record pop-up menus, so here are some screens of logging and transaction creation/editing:
